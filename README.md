# applied-ml-projects
Contains the projects worked on as a team for our Applied Machine Learning course ([COMP 551]([url](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/courses/comp-551))) at McGill University in 2024. The team consisted of [Ayaz Ciplak]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayazc/)), [Jackie Silver]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-silver-618a44232/)), and [Christopher Smith]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-smith-cps/)).

The projects involved building various models from scratch, finetuning pretrained models to our particular use cases, and exploring different methods to enhance our models' performance using techniques like regularization or data augmentation. There were four main projects worked on over the course of the semester:
  * Regression Models
  * Exploring Model Complexity
  * Neural Networks
  * LLMs

Many thanks to Professors [Reihaneh Rabbany]([url](https://www.reirab.com/)) and [Isabeau Pr√©mont-Schwarz]([url](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~isabeau/)), as well as the TA staff who made this course possible.
